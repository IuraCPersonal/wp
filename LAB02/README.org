# HTTP, CACHING AND REDIRECTS

## NOTE:

During the development of this software, all the test were done in the Windows PowerShell - meaning that all the outputs were designed to match the terminal's standards.
I noticed that in a Bash shell, the output might not look as great. Thank you for your understanding. Future improvements in coming...
